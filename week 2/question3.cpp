/* 
Write C++ statement(s) that accomplish the following:
o Declare int variables x and y. Initialize x to 25 and y to 18.
o Declare and initialize an int variable temp to 10 and a char variable ch to 'A'.
o Update the value of an int variable x by adding 5 to it.
o Declare and initialize a double variable payRate to 12.50.
o Copy the value of an int variable firstNum into an int variable tempNum.
o Swap the contents of the int variables x and y. (Declare additional variables, if necessary.)
o Suppose x and y are double variables. Output the contents of x, y, and the expression x+12/y-18.
o Declare a char variable grade and set the value of grade to 'A'.
o Declare int variables to store four integers.
o Copy the value of a double variable z to the nearest integer into an int variable x.
